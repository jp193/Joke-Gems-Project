### Project Description
- Our phase 1 project displays random jokes, quotes, and advice depending on what button is clicked. We created various buttons that when clicked will pull from a specific API and display the corresponding content.

- Each button is tied to a click event that is also wrapped in a function so our code is more cleaner when  the context is reused.

- Our css file contains various classes and attributes to present a more visually appealing page.

- The Html files contain multiple ID's that identify appropriate to be called later.

- ADDED a save feature. so you can locally store all your favorite jokes, quotes, and advice.
